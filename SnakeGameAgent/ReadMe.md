# Project Title: Snake AI Agent
## Description:
The project aim is to develop an ai driven player for the classic snake with a twist. In this version, there are 4 snakes in the board during each game. The game ends after 5 minutes (not when the snake dies since there are multiple snakes). 
The snake driven by the code in this local version of the game is the red snake and it is competing with 3 other snakes to eat the most apples.
